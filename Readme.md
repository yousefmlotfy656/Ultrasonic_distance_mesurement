Ultrasonic Distance Meter using Arduino and LCD
This project demonstrates how to create an Ultrasonic Distance Meter using Arduino and an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) to measure distances accurately. The Ultrasonic Distance Meter uses an ultrasonic sensor to determine the distance between the sensor and an object. The distance measured is then displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen.

Code Explanation
The Arduino code provided for the Ultrasonic Distance Meter initializes the LCD and the Ultrasonic Sensor. It then calculates the distance based on the time taken for the ultrasonic wave to bounce back after being emitted by the sensor.

Uploading the Code
Connect the Arduino board to your computer, open the Arduino IDE, and upload the code to the board. Make sure you have selected the correct board and COM port in the Arduino IDE before uploading.

Usage
After uploading the code, the Ultrasonic Distance Meter is ready to measure distances. The LCD will display the distance in both centimeters (cm) and meters (m). Place the Ultrasonic Sensor facing an object, and the measured distance will be displayed on the LCD screen.

Enjoy experimenting with the Ultrasonic Distance Meter! You can use this project as a foundation for more complex distance measurement systems or integrate it into other Arduino projects that require distance sensing capabilities.
